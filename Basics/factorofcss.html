        <dt><b>Specificity:</b></dt>
        <dd>CSS rules can target elements in various ways, such as by tag name, class, ID, or attribute. When multiple
            rules apply to an element, the br owser uses specificity to determine which rule to apply. Specificity is
            calculated based on a hierarchy where ID selectors have the highest specificity, followed by class
            selectors, and then element selectors. Inline styles have the highest specificity of all.
        </dd>
        <dt><b>Inheritance:</b></dt>
        <dd>Certain CSS properties are inherited from parent elements to their children. For instance, properties like
            color and font-family are inherited, while properties like margin and padding are not. Understanding which
            properties are inherited helps in predicting how styles will be applied to nested elements and avoiding
            unnecessary repetition.
        </dd>
        <dt><b>Cascade:</b></dt>
        <dd>
            The cascade is the order in which styles are applied. This includes the source of the styles (e.g., external
            stylesheets, internal styles, inline styles) and the importance of the rules (normal, important). The
            cascade determines the final computed style of an element based on the order of rules, the specificity of
            the selectors, and the !important declarations.
        </dd>
        <dt><b>Context:</b></dt>
        <dd>The context in which CSS is applied includes the browser and its version, as different browsers can render
            CSS differently. Additionally, the context of media queries affects how styles are applied based on the
            device's characteristics like screen size, resolution, and orientation. This ensures that designs are
            responsive and adapt to various devices and viewing conditions.
